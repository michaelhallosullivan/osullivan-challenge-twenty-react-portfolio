          My name is Michael O'Sullivan (He/Him). I am a 30 year old male born in the California Bay Area. I'm currently changing careers and expanding my skillset by taking the UCB extension coding bootcamp. I like to play video games, cook, go for hikes, and practice archery. Feel free to poke around the other tabs to see some of my work and reach out.
